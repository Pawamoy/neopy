# neopy
Neo4j for Python. Manipulate graph data in Python with Neo4j as data storage.

The goal of this library is to provide a Python interface for querying and
manipulating data stored in a Neo4j database.

This is a very early attempt, not even alpha.

The first wanted feature is the ability to write Cypher queries in Python,
using the power of Cypher without its syntax. This results in a more verbose
but more flexible query language.
